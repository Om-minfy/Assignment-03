## Advanced Features

### Global State with Context & Reducer
- Implemented a centralized global state using React.createContext + useReducer.
- This allows the detail page and favorites page to both interact with the favorites list.
- Avoids the need to pass props deeply across components.

### Data Persistence with localStorage
- On load, the app checks localStorage and preloads the user's favorite recipes.
- Any changes to the favorites list are automatically written back to localStorage.
- This makes the experience seamless and persistent across sessions.
